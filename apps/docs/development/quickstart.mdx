## Cloning the repository

To get started with the development environment, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/buchungapp/nationaal-watersportdiploma.git ./nwd
```

Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd nwd
```

## Installing dependencies

### Package manager

The NWD project uses [pnpm v8](https://pnpm.io/8.x/installation) as the package manager.
Please make sure you are using the correct version, to prevent any issues.

Alternatively, you can use: `npx pnpm@v8 <command>`

### Initialization

To install the dependencies and build the api, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm initialize
```

## Setting up Supabase

The NWD project uses [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) as the database and auth provider.
You can follow the quide at [supabase.io/docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started) to get started.

We also provide a simplified guide below.

<Accordion title="Setting up Supabase for local development">

To get started, you need to install the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/getting-started).

```bash
pnpm add -g supabase
```

And install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) for supabase to run locally.

</Accordion>

Then you are ready to start the Supabase server.

```bash
supabase start
```

## Setting up the database

To set up the database, run the following command:

<Warning>
  This command will run database migrations and **reset** the database.
</Warning>

```bash
pnpm db:reset
```

After this we want to seed the database with some initial data. This will add a simple course and sailing school to the database.

<Note>
  None of the course requirements and users are real and are only for testing
  purposes.
</Note>

```bash
pnpm db:seed
```

### Example users add by the seed
